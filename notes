# CyberPulse Development Notes

## Data Sources
- CISA KEV Catalog: https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog
- NVD API: https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/vulnerabilities
- PhishTank API: https://phishtank.org/api_info.php
- URLhaus API: https://urlhaus-api.abuse.ch/
- VirusTotal API: https://developers.virustotal.com/reference/overview

## Machine Learning Model Architecture
1. **Vulnerability Risk Assessment Model**
   - Input: Vulnerability metadata (CVSS scores, attack vectors, etc.)
   - Output: Probability of exploitation in the wild
   - Architecture: Dense neural network with 3 layers

2. **Attack Prediction Model**
   - Input: Target metadata (sector, region) + recent vulnerabilities
   - Output: Probability of different attack types
   - Architecture: Dense neural network with time-series features

3. **Feature Engineering Notes**
   - One-hot encode categorical features (sectors, regions)
   - Normalize numerical features
   - Handle missing values with reasonable defaults
   - Consider feature importance analysis to improve models

## UI Design Inspiration
- Cyberpunk 2077 interface: https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Cyberpunk_2077
- Holographic interfaces from sci-fi films
- Use gradients of cyan, magenta, and yellow for cyberpunk feel
- Animated grid backgrounds and scanlines for retro-futuristic look

## Development Roadmap
1. **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**
   - Set up Next.js project with TypeScript
   - Implement database schema and migrations
   - Create API routes for data sources
   - Implement authentication

2. **Phase 2: Data Processing**
   - Build data fetchers for external APIs
   - Implement data normalization
   - Create ML model architecture
   - Train initial models with sample data

3. **Phase 3: UI Components**
   - Design and implement dashboard layouts
   - Create visualization components
   - Build prediction cards and threat displays
   - Implement interactive attack map

4. **Phase 4: Integration**
   - Connect ML predictions to UI
   - Set up real-time updates
   - Implement user alerts
   - Add customization options

5. **Phase 5: Deployment**
   - Set up Docker containers
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline
   - Implement monitoring
   - Optimize performance

## Technical Considerations
- Use SQLite for development, consider PostgreSQL for production
- TensorFlow.js for ML model serving
- Use Server Components where possible for better performance
- Implement appropriate caching for external API calls
- Set up regular data collection jobs

## Known Issues & Limitations
- NVD API has rate limits (5 requests per 30 seconds without API key)
- Some data sources require paid API keys for production use
- ML models need substantial training data for accuracy
- Performance considerations for real-time visualization

## Ideas for Future Enhancements
- Add user-specific dashboards and alerts
- Implement natural language explanations for predictions
- Add more data sources for improved accuracy
- Create an API for external integrations
- Add mobile app support
