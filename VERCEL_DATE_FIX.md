# Vercel Date Normalization Fix

This fix addresses the "TypeError: e.toISOString is not a function" error that occurs in Vercel deployments but not locally. This problem happens because of differences in how dates are handled between environments.

## Automated Setup

Run these commands to automatically set up the fix:

```bash
# Set up application entry points and API routes
npm run setup-date-fix

# If you've already built your app, fix the built JS files
npm run fix-date-error

# Run diagnostics to test the fix
npm run vercel-diagnostic
